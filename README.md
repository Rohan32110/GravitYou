## Title:

Gravitational Force on Different Planets (GravitYou)

## Introduction:

The "Gravitational Force on Different Planets (GravitYou)" project is a Qt-based application 
designed to calculate an individual's weight on the eight planets of our solar 
system. This educational tool aims to help users understand the variations in 
gravitational force across different celestial bodies and provides insights into how 
this force would affect an individual's weight.

## Methodology:

The project was developed using the Qt framework, a versatile and powerful C++ 
library known for its ability to create cross-platform graphical user interfaces 
(GUIs). Qt's extensive set of tools and libraries allowed us to build an intuitive and 
interactive interface for the Gravitational Force on Different Planets application.

## Working Principle:

The Gravitational Force on Different Planets application operates based on the following 
working principle:
1. User Input: Users enter their weight in kilograms (kg) into the application.
2. Planet Selection: Users choose one of the eight planets (Mercury, Venus, 
Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, or Neptune) from a predefined list.
3. Gravitational Force Calculation: The application calculates the gravitational force on the 
selected planet using the user's weight and the respective gravitational 
acceleration of the chosen planet.
4. Display Result: The calculated weight on the selected planet is displayed, 
along with a message describing the impact of this weight on that planet.

## Features:

Key features of the Gravitational Force on Different Planets project include:

• Eight Planet Support: The application supports calculations for all eight 
planets in our solar system.

• Informative Messages: Users receive informative messages about how their 
weight compares to what it would be on Earth, helping them grasp the 
concept of Gravitational Force variation.

• User-Friendly Interface: The Qt-based GUI provides an intuitive and visually 
appealing experience for users of all ages.

• Educational Tool: The project serves as an educational resource for 
students and science enthusiasts interested in planetary science.

## Limitations:

Despite its educational value, the Gravity on Different Planets application has 
certain limitations:


• Limited Planetary Data: The application focuses on weight calculations and 
does not provide detailed planetary information beyond gravitational 
acceleration.

• Simplified Model: The calculations are based on simplified models that do 
not consider variations in gravitational acceleration due to altitude or other 
factors.

## Conclusion:

The Gravitational Force on Different Planets project offers a fun and educational way for users 
to explore the impact of gravity on different celestial bodies within our solar 
system. By leveraging the Qt framework, it provides an engaging and interactive 
experience for users to better understand the concept of weight variation on 
other planets.

This project highlights the importance of technology in simplifying complex 
concepts and making science more accessible to a wide audience, especially in the 
fields of astronomy and planetary science.
